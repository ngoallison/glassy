# glassy

glassy is a cross-platform mobile application built with the MERN stack, replacing React with React Native, designed to document and support your skincare journey. Whether you're a skincare enthusiast or just starting, glassy can help you achieve your perfect skin!

## About
glassy aims to be your very own personal skincare assistant. As someone who has dozens of skincare products with limited memory of what works, what doesn't, or what order to apply them in, glassy is exactly what I need as my personal notebook to reference.

It helps you document your skincare journey by recording your products, writing reviews for them, logging progress through notes and photos, and building daily skincare routines. 

## Features
**Product Recording:** Record and keep track of the skincare products you use

**Product Reviews:** Write and read reviews for various skincare products.

**Filtered Searches:** Easily search for products using filters like type, brand, and ingredients.

**Progress Logs:** Write detailed logs paired with photos to track your skincare progress over time.

**Routine Building:** Create and manage your ever-changing personalized skincare routines.

**Cross-Platform:** Compatible on both iOS and Android devices.
